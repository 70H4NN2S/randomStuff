# DuckDuckGo Website Clone

I am at the moment learning WEB DEV with [Platzi](https://platzi.com), and the first practical course was to make a clone of google chrome.
But I decided to switch the task a little bit, because I wanted to challenge myself a little bit and don't fall into the copy paste trap. That's why I am cloning another Search Engine, [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com).
