# Mastermind

A exercise from the university, in which you have te create a game like the board game [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) which challenges you to guess a color code, in a limitted amount of tries.
Because this is only a introductory lecture to coding, we have to implement the game just in the terminal, replacing the colors to numbers from 1 to 8.
